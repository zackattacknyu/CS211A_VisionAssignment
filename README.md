=======================

Vision assignment code and docs

This folder consists of the matlab code, text files,
	and some of the pictures used in the process
	of completing the Vision Assignment. 
	
The following scripts are the main scripts to run:
	visionAssignment_book
	visionAssignment_computer
	visionAssignment_square

These scripts call all the other functions used. 

The book script compiles all the data for the book object
	and then attempts to make the 3D plot of it.
The computer script does the same thing for the computer object.
The square script does the same thing for the simple rectangle.
